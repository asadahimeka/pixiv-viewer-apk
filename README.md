## FAQ

### How to preset the image proxy and API instance if you build it yourself?

Refer to [#10](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/10) and [#13](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/discussions/13).
You can create a new `.env` file in the root directory of the project and fill in the environment variables in the format of `.env.example`.

### Why can't I view some artworks using a US/UK IP?

See the official pixiv announcement: https://www.pixiv.net/info.php?id=10837

It is recommended to log in to this site with your own account before using it, and select a non-US/UK region in the official web page [settings](https://www.pixiv.net/setting_user.php). It is best to select the Japan region.

### List and details do not match or repeat, search results do not match the search label

It is caused by the CDN cache of the self-built API, you can switch other API instances in the settings or use it after logging in.

### Keep prompting that the API exceeds the limit or Rate Limit

You can switch the API instance in the settings or log in directly using RefreshToken or OAuth.

### How to get RefreshToken

See https://www.nanoka.top/posts/e78ef86/

### Image loading is very slow

Image loading speed may be slow due to network conditions. You can switch to the image proxy in the settings, or download the Android version and turn on the image direct connection function.

### Cookie/SessionID login error

It is recommended to use RefreshToken to log in

### Is there an iOS App?

You can download it from [Github Releases](https://github.com/asadahimeka/pixiv-viewer/releases). Note that the iOS installation package is not signed, so you need to sign it yourself. Tutorials: [AltStore](https://faq.AltStore.io)

### Android version crashes after clicking download

Go to the system settings to give this application storage permissions, or download the latest version and try again.
